# Emulator, OS, Compiler (EOC)

A comprehensive educational long-term project on computers from hardware,
system software, application software, which would also illustrate how
code gets to machine code and vice versa.

## Contents

Currently, an Intel 8051AH microcontroller emulator and an exokernel-based
hard real-time operating system are being written. Later on a compiler
of C/Python to the A51 assembly will be implemented.
