# Emulator, OS, Compiler (EOC)

A comprehensive educational project on computers from hardware, system
software, to application software.

## Contents

The device to emulate would be Cortex A-53 processor which implements the
Armv8-A architecture. It will run an RTOS similar to FreeRTOS (?).

## Steps

1. Emulator, so we can run the OS on an emulated hardware,
2. OS, so we can have a platform to target with the compiler,
3. Compiler, so we can learn about compilation.
